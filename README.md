# JavaScript Best Practices

This repository contains the interactive examples I used
in my "JavaScript Best Practices" tech talk at Offerpop
on Tuesday, August 25, 2015.

## How To Run

> **NOTE:**
> These examples use ES6 features that many browsers don't support yet.
> You will need to use the latest nightly version of Firefox to run them.

If you want to look at these examples locally,
follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in Firefox Nightly.
